TCP Stuff:
Okay, it actually looks very simple.
The best resource I found was: https://www.baeldung.com/a-guide-to-java-sockets
second best was: https://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/java-socket-server-examples-tcp-ip

How I would go about it is: Copy paste the client and server code then tailor it to work for our purposes. I don't think there should be too much to change around.

The biggest thing to do, I think, is the setting up of the network aka connecting each peer to eachother. 

Stuff to do:
-Set up client
-Set up Server
-Write the code to connect each peer to all other peers and  hold connections in map or something like that
